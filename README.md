# goldbach-conjecture

The Goldbach Conjecture is a yet unproven conjecture stating that every even integer greater than two is the sum of two prime numbers. The conjecture has been tested up to 400,000,000,000,000.

Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory and in all of mathematics.


For example,

$4 = 2 + 2$

$6 = 3 + 3$

$8 = 3 + 5$

$10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5$

$12 = 5 + 7$

$14 = 3 + 11 = 7 + 7$ etc.
